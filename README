SYNOPSIS

     use Text::Chart qw(gen_text_chart);

    Bar chart:

     my $res = gen_text_chart(
         data => [1, 5, 3, 9, 2],
         type => 'bar',
     );

    will produce this:

     *
     *****
     ***
     *********
     **

    Adding data labels and showing data values:

     my $res = gen_text_chart(
         data => [["Andi",1], ["Budi",5], ["Cinta",3], ["Dewi",9], ["Edi",2]],
         type => 'bar',
         show_data_label => 1,
         show_data_value => 1,
     );

    Result:

     Andi |*         (1)
     Budi |*****     (5)
     Cinta|***       (3)
     Dewi |********* (9)
     Edi  |**        (2)

    Column chart:

     my $res = gen_text_chart(
         data => [["Andi",1], ["Budi",5], ["Cinta",3], ["Dewi",9], ["Edi",2]],
         type => 'column',
         show_data_label => 1,
     );

    Result:

                         *
                         *
                         *
                         *
            *            *
            *            *
      *     *      *     *
      *     *      *     *     *
      *     *      *     *     *
     Andi  Budi  Cinta  Dewi  Edi

    Sparkline chart:

     my $res = gen_text_chart(
         data => [["Andi",1], ["Budi",5], ["Cinta",3], ["Dewi",9], ["Edi",2]],
         type => 'column',
         show_data_label => 1,
     );
    
     my $res = gen_text_chart(
         data => [1.5, 0.5, 3.5, 2.5, 5.5, 4.5, 7.5, 6.5],
         type => 'sparkline',
     );

    Result:

     XXX

    Plotting multiple data columns:

DESCRIPTION

    THIS IS AN EARLY RELEASE, MANY FEATURES ARE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED.
    Currently only sparkline chart is implemented. Showing data labels and
    data values are not yet implemented.

    This module lets you generate text-based charts.

FAQ

 Why am I getting 'Wide character in print/say' warning?

    You are probably printing Unicode characters to STDOUT without doing
    something like this beforehand:

     binmode(STDOUT, ":utf8");

SEE ALSO

    Text::Graph, a mature CPAN module for doing text-based graphs. Before
    writing Text::Chart I used this module for a while, but ran into the
    problem of weird generated graphs. In addition, I don't like the way
    Text::Graph draws things, e.g. a data value of 1 is drawn as zero-width
    bar, or the label separator : is always drawn. So I decided to write an
    alternative charting module instead. Compared to Text::Graph, here are
    the things I want to add or do differently as well: functional (non-OO)
    interface, colors, Unicode, resampling, more chart types like
    sparkline, animation and some interactivity (perhaps).
